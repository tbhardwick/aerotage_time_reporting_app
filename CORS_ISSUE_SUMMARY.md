# âœ… CORS Configuration Issue - RESOLVED

## ðŸŽ‰ **Issue Status: RESOLVED**

The API team has successfully configured CORS headers and the health check endpoint is now working properly!

## âœ… **What Was Fixed**

1. **CORS Headers Configured**: `http://localhost:3000` and `http://localhost:3001` are now allowed
2. **Health Endpoint Made Public**: `/health` no longer requires authentication
3. **Standard API Response Format**: Returns `{"success": true, "data": {...}}` format
4. **All HTTP Methods Supported**: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS all working

## ðŸ“Š **Current Health Check Response**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "status": "healthy",
    "timestamp": "2025-05-28T14:08:14.019Z",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "environment": "dev",
    "services": {
      "api": "healthy",
      "database": "healthy",
      "auth": "healthy"
    },
    "uptime": 657
  }
}
```

## âœ… **Frontend Status**

- âœ… **Health check re-enabled**: Auto-refresh every 60 seconds
- âœ… **CORS working**: No more blocked requests
- âœ… **Authentication removed**: Health endpoint is now public
- âœ… **UI showing status**: Green checkmark in navigation
- âœ… **Detailed monitoring**: Available in Settings â†’ API Status

## ðŸŽ¯ **Testing Confirmed**

```bash
# Health endpoint working without authentication
curl https://time-api-dev.aerotage.com/health
# Returns: {"success":true,"data":{"status":"healthy",...}}

# CORS headers present for localhost:3000
# No more "blocked by CORS policy" errors
```

## ðŸš€ **Ready for Development**

The frontend can now:
- âœ… Test connectivity with the health endpoint
- âœ… Make authenticated API calls with proper CORS headers  
- âœ… Use all HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.)
- âœ… Access the interactive documentation for API exploration

**Status**: âœ… **RESOLVED** - API is fully configured and ready for frontend integration!
