# Remember Username Feature

## Overview
The login form now includes a "Remember my email address" feature that saves the user's email address locally for convenience on subsequent logins.

## User Experience

### First Login
- User enters email and password
- "Remember my email address" checkbox is checked by default
- On successful login, email is saved to localStorage

### Subsequent Logins
- Email field is pre-populated with the last successful login email
- User only needs to enter their password
- Checkbox state reflects the current preference

### User Control
- **Checkbox Checked**: Email will be remembered and pre-filled
- **Checkbox Unchecked**: Email will not be saved, field starts empty
- **Explicit Logout**: Clears the remembered email (but keeps preference)

## Technical Implementation

### Storage Mechanism
- **`rememberedUsername`**: Stores the actual email address
- **`rememberUsername`**: Stores the user's preference (true/false)

### Security Considerations
- Only stores email address (username), never passwords
- Email is not sensitive data - safe for localStorage
- Cleared on explicit logout for shared computer scenarios
- No automatic session persistence (still requires password)

### Behavior Details

#### On Component Mount
1. Check if user has enabled "remember username" preference
2. If enabled, load and populate the last successful email
3. Set checkbox state based on preference

#### On Login Success
1. If "remember username" is enabled, save the email
2. Continue with normal login flow

#### On Explicit Logout
1. Clear the remembered email address
2. Keep the user's preference setting
3. Continue with normal logout flow

#### On Checkbox Change
1. Update preference in localStorage immediately
2. If unchecked, clear any stored email
3. If checked and email exists, save it

## Benefits

### User Experience
- **Faster Login**: Reduces typing on daily logins
- **Convenience**: Especially valuable for business users who login daily
- **Industry Standard**: Matches user expectations from other applications

### Business Value
- **Reduced Friction**: Faster access to time tracking
- **User Satisfaction**: Modern, expected functionality
- **Productivity**: Less time spent on login process

## Edge Cases Handled

1. **Shared Computers**: Explicit logout clears remembered email
2. **Multiple Users**: Each user can have their own preference
3. **Privacy Concerns**: Easy to disable via checkbox
4. **Browser/App Reset**: Gracefully handles missing localStorage data

## Future Enhancements

Potential future improvements:
- Multiple remembered usernames (dropdown selection)
- Integration with system keychain for enhanced security
- Remember last successful login time
- Auto-focus password field when email is pre-filled

## Testing Scenarios

1. **New User**: Checkbox checked by default, no pre-filled email
2. **Returning User**: Email pre-filled, checkbox reflects preference
3. **Disable Feature**: Uncheck box, email cleared on next visit
4. **Explicit Logout**: Email cleared, but preference preserved
5. **Multiple Logins**: Last successful email always remembered
