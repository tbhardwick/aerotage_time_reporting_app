### üéØ **Phase 8 Requirements Summary**
- **User Profile Management**: Personal info, preferences, hourly rates
- **User Creation & Onboarding**: Admin interface, email invitations, account setup
- **Role & Permission System**: Granular access control, feature-level permissions
- **Team Management**: Hierarchical teams, manager assignment, member management
- **Activity Monitoring**: Login history, session management, security tracking
- **Bulk Operations**: User import/export, bulk status updates, analytics

### üöÄ **Next Steps: Ready to Begin Phase 8**
1. **Create feature branch** for user management development
2. **Enhance AppContext** with user management state and actions
3. **Develop user management components** and interfaces
4. **Implement role-based access control** throughout the application
5. **Add comprehensive testing** for user management features
6. **Update documentation** and deployment guides

*The application foundation is solid and ready for the final Phase 8 enhancement to achieve complete enterprise readiness.* üéØ
