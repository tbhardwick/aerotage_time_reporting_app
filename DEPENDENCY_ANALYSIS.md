# Dependency Stability Analysis

## Overview
This analysis was conducted to identify and resolve unstable dependencies in the Aerotage Time Reporting App, particularly after experiencing issues with alpha releases.

## Findings

### üö® Critical Issues Found

#### 1. Alpha Release Dependencies
- **electron-reload**: ‚úÖ **FIXED**
  - **Issue**: Alpha release, potentially unstable
  - **Latest Stable**: `1.5.0`
  - **Action Taken**: Updated to stable version `1.5.0`

#### 2. Security Vulnerabilities
- **xlsx**: Currently using `^0.18.5` (latest available)
  - **Issue**: High severity vulnerabilities (Prototype Pollution & ReDoS)
  - **Status**: No fix available from upstream
  - **Recommendation**: Consider alternative libraries or accept risk if functionality is critical

### üìä Outdated Stable Dependencies

| Package | Current | Updated To | Latest | Status | Priority |
|---------|---------|------------|--------|--------|----------|
| electron | ~~36.0.0~~ | ‚úÖ 36.3.1 | 36.3.1 | **UPDATED** | Medium |
| electron-store | ~~8.2.0~~ | ‚úÖ 10.0.1 | 10.0.1 | **UPDATED** | Medium |
| electron-builder | 25.1.8 | - | 26.0.12 | Pending | Low-Medium |
| eslint | 8.57.1 | - | 9.27.0 | Pending | Low |
| tailwindcss | 3.4.17 | - | 4.1.7 | Pending | Low* |

*Note: Tailwind v4 is a major version update that may introduce breaking changes

### ‚úÖ Dependencies Using Stable Versions
- React 19.1.0 (stable)
- TypeScript 5.8.3 (stable)
- All other dependencies are using stable releases

## Completed Actions ‚úÖ

### 1. Critical Fixes (COMPLETED)
- [x] Replace `electron-reload@^2.0.0-alpha.1` with `electron-reload@^1.5.0`
- [x] Update electron to 36.3.1 
- [x] Update electron-store to 10.0.1

## Recommended Actions

### 2. Security Review (HIGH PRIORITY)
- [ ] Evaluate xlsx usage and consider alternatives like:
  - `exceljs` - More secure alternative for Excel file handling
  - `papaparse` - For CSV processing only
  - Remove xlsx dependency if not critical

### 3. Consider Later (Low Priority)
- [ ] ESLint 9.x (major version, may have breaking changes)
- [ ] Tailwind CSS 4.x (major version, significant changes expected)
- [ ] electron-builder 26.x (test thoroughly for compatibility)

## Implementation Plan

1. **Phase 1**: ‚úÖ Fix alpha dependency (electron-reload) - COMPLETED
2. **Phase 2**: ‚úÖ Update patch/minor versions - COMPLETED  
3. **Phase 3**: Address xlsx security vulnerability
4. **Phase 4**: Evaluate major version updates separately

## Test Results

After updating dependencies:
- ‚úÖ Dependencies installed successfully
- ‚ö†Ô∏è 1 high severity vulnerability remains (xlsx package)
- üß™ Application testing required

## Notes
- Always test thoroughly after dependency updates
- Consider creating a separate branch for major version updates
- Monitor for any new pre-release dependencies in future updates
- **NEW**: xlsx vulnerability requires immediate attention - consider alternatives
