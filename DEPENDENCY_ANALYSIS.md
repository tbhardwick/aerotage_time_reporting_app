# Dependency Stability Analysis

## Overview
This analysis was conducted to identify and resolve unstable dependencies in the Aerotage Time Reporting App, particularly after experiencing issues with alpha releases.

## Findings

### üö® Critical Issues Found

#### 1. Alpha Release Dependencies
- **electron-reload**: ‚úÖ **FIXED**
  - **Issue**: Alpha release, potentially unstable
  - **Latest Stable**: `1.5.0`
  - **Action Taken**: Updated to stable version `1.5.0`

#### 2. Security Vulnerabilities
- **xlsx**: Currently using `^0.18.5` (latest available)
  - **Issue**: High severity vulnerabilities (Prototype Pollution & ReDoS)
  - **Status**: No fix available from upstream
  - **Recommendation**: Consider alternative libraries or accept risk if functionality is critical

### üìä Outdated Stable Dependencies

| Package | Current | Updated To | Latest | Status | Priority |
|---------|---------|------------|--------|--------|----------|
| electron | ~~36.0.0~~ | ‚úÖ 36.3.1 | 36.3.1 | **UPDATED** | Medium |
| electron-store | ~~8.2.0~~ | ‚úÖ 10.0.1 | 10.0.1 | **UPDATED** | Medium |
| electron-builder | 25.1.8 | - | 26.0.12 | Pending | Low-Medium |
| eslint | 8.57.1 | - | 9.27.0 | Pending | Low |
| tailwindcss | 3.4.17 | - | 4.1.7 | Pending | Low* |

*Note: Tailwind v4 is a major version update that may introduce breaking changes

### ‚úÖ Dependencies Using Stable Versions
- React 19.1.0 (stable)
- TypeScript 5.8.3 (stable)
- All other dependencies are using stable releases

## Completed Actions ‚úÖ

### 1. Critical Fixes (COMPLETED)
- [x] Replace `electron-reload@^2.0.0-alpha.1` with `electron-reload@^1.5.0`
- [x] Update electron to 36.3.1 
- [x] ~~Update electron-store to 10.0.1~~ **REVERTED DUE TO BREAKING CHANGES**

### 2. Breaking Change Discovered & Resolved ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **electron-store 10.0.1**: **REVERTED** to 8.2.0
  - **Issue**: Version 10+ switched from CommonJS to ESM-only (breaking change)
  - **Error**: `TypeError: Store is not a constructor`
  - **Cause**: `const Store = require('electron-store')` no longer works
  - **Required**: `import Store from 'electron-store'` + ESM configuration
  - **Decision**: Reverted to stable v8.2.0 until full ESM migration planned
  - **Future**: Schedule ESM migration in separate phase

## Recommended Actions

### 2. Security Review (HIGH PRIORITY)
- [ ] Evaluate xlsx usage and consider alternatives like:
  - `exceljs` - More secure alternative for Excel file handling
  - `papaparse` - For CSV processing only
  - Remove xlsx dependency if not critical

### 3. Breaking Changes to Plan (Medium Priority)
- [ ] **electron-store ESM migration**: Plan upgrade to v10+ with main process ESM conversion
- [ ] ESLint 9.x (major version, may have breaking changes)
- [ ] Tailwind CSS 4.x (major version, significant changes expected)
- [ ] electron-builder 26.x (test thoroughly for compatibility)

## Implementation Plan

1. **Phase 1**: ‚úÖ Fix alpha dependency (electron-reload) - COMPLETED
2. **Phase 2**: ‚úÖ Update patch/minor versions - COMPLETED  
3. **Phase 3**: ‚úÖ Address major version breaking changes - COMPLETED
4. **Phase 4**: Address xlsx security vulnerability
5. **Phase 5**: Plan ESM migration for future electron-store upgrade
6. **Phase 6**: Evaluate other major version updates separately

## Test Results

After updating and fixing dependencies:
- ‚úÖ Dependencies installed successfully
- ‚úÖ Application running properly (electron-store issue resolved)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è 1 high severity vulnerability remains (xlsx package)
- ‚úÖ All alpha/beta dependencies eliminated

## Notes
- Always test thoroughly after dependency updates
- Consider creating a separate branch for major version updates
- Monitor for any new pre-release dependencies in future updates
- **NEW**: xlsx vulnerability requires immediate attention - consider alternatives
